This is a simple conversion of the following HTML to JSX:

<div class="profile-card">
  <h2>User Profile</h2>
  <img src="https://example.com/user-photo.jpg" alt="User Photo" class="photo"/>
  <p>Name: Jane Doe</p>
  <p>Email: jane.doe@example.com</p>
  <a href="mailto:jane.doe@example.com">Send Email</a>
</div>

I built some CSS with the help of java script to make it a bit easier, also loaded a photo locally
instead of using a href to make it so it can load the image for sure

this uses Next.JS
 so simply hit
 npm start to run after CDing
